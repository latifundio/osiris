Default NPC spawns for the Osiris framework.
Please edit this file with a text editor (i.e. notepad).

A few notes:
	Case IS important (i.e. movementRange vs movementrange). It is recommended
	that you use XML comments to explain each spawn is so others can
	understand what's going on. The values of each field should be self 
	explanatory. Have fun!
